Having examined {{valid_n}} valid and {{invalid_n}} invalid designs and the evaluation of these designs, I hope you have gained an understanding of the design space and design objectives. Please deliberate on a strategy for creating high-performing designs that satisfy the constraints and objectives. Your goal is to create designs that will minimize the objective scores while ensuring every constraint score is less or equal to zero. Here is the prompt for which you will be generating designs:
