You must create {{out_n}} unique bicycle design that satisfy the constraints and objectives. Important: You are not allowed to generate the same bike {{out_n}} times. Each design must be unique! You are also encouraged to improve over the valid designs given to you, which may not be very optimal. Please provide the designs in a {{out_n}} x 64 csv file with one extra column for the index and one extra row for the column hearers. Please count up from 1 - {{out_n}} in the indices. For the column headers, we recommend you use the parameter names described to help you keep track of what parameter is what. Remember! Every design must be unique. Your final output must be only the csv itself, nothing more. Generate the csv file now.
