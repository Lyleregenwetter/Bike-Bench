Before asking you to design the bikes, I will provide a dataset of existing bicycle designs to reference. These are useful as a reference point, because it may be difficult to satisfy constraints and objectives if you deviate too far from the space of existing designs. I will also provide a set of objective scores for these bicycle designs. Here is the conditional input for the bicycle generation task. The bikes I will show later will correspond one-to-one with these conditions:
