Descriptions of all objectives and constraints in the standard bike-bench multi-objective engineering design benchmark. Some evaluation criteria are contingent on only the bike design, while others are also contingent on the conditional information. By convention, objectives are minimized at 0, with lower values being better. Constraints are also minimized, with 0 being the critical value. Larger positive values indicate more extreme constraint violation and larger magnitude negative values are more constraint-satisfying. In general, once a constraint is satisfied, we no longer care about further minimizing the value. However, achieving constraints is critical because designs that violate constraints are invalid. Thus, we must attempt to ensure that all constraints are simultaneously below zero. 

The 50 objectives and constraints are described as follows:

1: Usability Score [Objective]: The predicted 'usability,' as rated by a human, with 0 being the most usable and 1 being the least usable. Predicted by a regression model trained on human-collected ratings.
2: Drag Force (N) [Objective]: The predicted drag force in N incurred by the cyclist in a 10 m/s headwind, as predicted by a regression model trained on computational fluid dynamics simulation data.
3: Knee Angle Error (deg.) [Objective]: The difference between the minimum knee angle of the cyclist and the optimal reference range. May include a penalty term if the rider's geometry is completely incompatible with the bike. 
4: Hip Angle Error (deg.) [Objective]: The difference between the torso-to-upper-leg angle of the cyclist and the optimal reference range. May include a penalty term if the rider's geometry is completely incompatible with the bike.
5: Arm Angle Error (deg.) [Objective]: The difference between the torso-to-arm angle of the cyclist and the optimal reference range. May include a penalty term if the rider's geometry is completely incompatible with the bike.
6: Arm Too Long for Bike [Constraint]: Constraint indicating that the length of the rider's arm is longer than the length of the rider's torso plus the distance from the saddle to the handlebars. Means the saddle is too close to the handlebars. 
7: Saddle Too Far From Handle [Constraint]: Constraint indicating that the distance from the saddle to the handlebars is longer than the length of the rider's torso plus the length of the rider's arm. Means the saddle is too far from the handlebars. 
8: Torso Too Long for Bike [Constraint]: Constraint indicating that the length of the rider's torso is longer than the length of the rider's arm plus the distance from the saddle to the handlebars. Means the saddle is too close to the handlebars. 
9: Saddle Too Far From Crank [Constraint]: Constraint indicating that the distance from the saddle to the pedals in the far position is longer than the length of the rider's upper leg plus the length of the rider's lower leg. Means the saddle is too far from the pedals. 
10: Upper Leg Too Long for Bike [Constraint]: Constraint indicating that the length of the rider's upper leg is longer than the distance from the saddle to the pedals in the far position plus the length of the rider's lower leg. Means the saddle is too close to the pedals. 
11: Lower Leg Too Long for Bike [Constraint]: Constraint indicating that the length of the rider's lower leg is longer than the distance from the saddle to the pedals in the far position plus the length of the rider's upper leg. Means the saddle is too close to the pedals. 
12: Cosine Distance To Embedding [Objective]: The cosine distance in the CLIP embedding space between the rendered bike image and the target text or image embedding.
