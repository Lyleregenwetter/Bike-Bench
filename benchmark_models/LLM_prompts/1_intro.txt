I will ask you to create some bicycle designs. The bicycle designs are subject to a set of conditions: a text prompt, some rider dimensions, and a use case. Each design is defined by 64 variables, which I will describe. Some of these are categorical variables, and I will provide you with the possible values for these variables. Others are continuous or boolean. I will describe the design variables shortly. Designs are evaluated according to a set of 50 criteria. 10 of these are objectives and 40 are constraints. Here are the descriptions of the design variables and the evaluation criteria:
