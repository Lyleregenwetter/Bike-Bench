    "The core bike-bench functionality depends on 5 predictive modeling datasets (aero, structure, validity, usability, clip) split into train and test sets and separated by features and labels for 20 files total. Additionally bike-bench relies on one generative modeling dataset split into train and test sets. For convenience, continous (bike_bench) and mixed-modality (bike_bench_mixed_modality) representations are provided directly for a total of 4 files. Files are automatically downloaded upon first use from Harvard Dataverse. The following code can be used to download and validate all datasets. "
